# csgo_score_generator
A python implementation of the original, 2500+ lines of horror code: https://github.com/Walks2K/CSGO-Score-Generator with improvements such as:
- Automatic game creation from HLTV match pages
- Automatic team creation from HLTV team pages

The idea is to implement a more well-made, OOP solution to the previous one messy file.
